# Slope-Fields
Attached are slope-field graphics and simulations.  These plots have been added to my professor's (Dr. Philip Yasskin's) online Calculus textbook. I coded these plots using the math program, Maple. Maple is definitely different from other languages I have used, but despite the learning curve, it is still pretty fun to use.
